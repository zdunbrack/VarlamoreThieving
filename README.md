# Varlamore Thieving Plugin for RuneLite

The Varlamore Thieving Plugin is designed to enhance the Thieving experience in Old School RuneScape when played through the RuneLite client. It provides real-time overlays and notifications to assist players in their thieving endeavors in Varlamore and surrounding areas.

## Features

- **NPC Tracking**: Automatically tracks specific NPCs (e.g., "Wealthy Citizens") and displays an overlay around them. The overlay helps players identify their targets quickly.
- **State Indicators**: NPCs display different colors based on their current state:
  - **Red**: Indicates an NPC is "Guarded".
  - **Green**: Indicates an NPC is "Distracted".
  - **Yellow**: Temporarily appears after an NPC performs a specific action (e.g., punching), indicating they are "Guarded" for a brief period.
- **Custom Notifications**: Players receive notifications for specific in-game events, such as when a homeowner is spotted returning.
- **Custom Chat Messages**: In certain scenarios, custom advice or tips are displayed in the game's chatbox to guide the player.

## Configuration Options

The plugin offers several configuration options that can be toggled in the RuneLite settings panel:

- **Enable Notifications**: Toggles whether in-game notifications are displayed for key events.
- **Enable Chat Messages**: Controls whether custom advice or tips are displayed in the chatbox.

## Usage

1. **Configuration**: Access the RuneLite settings panel, find the Varlamore Thieving Plugin, and adjust the settings according to your preference.
2. **In-Game**: As you play, the plugin will automatically track NPCs and display overlays. Notifications and chat messages will appear based on your configuration settings.
